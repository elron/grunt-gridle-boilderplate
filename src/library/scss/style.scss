/*
2. Layout
Layout rules divide the page into sections. Layouts hold one or more modules together.
*/
@import './layout/main.scss';

/*
3. Modules
Modules are the reusable, modular parts of our design. They are the callouts, the sidebar sections, the product lists and so on.
*/
@import './layout/modules/beautiful-form.scss';
@import './layout/modules/loading-screen.scss';

/*
4. State
State rules are ways to describe how our modules or layouts will look when in a particular state. 
*/


/*
5. Theme
Theme rules are similar to state rules in that they describe how modules or layouts might look.
Separating the theme out into its own set of styles allows for those styles to be easily redefined for alternate themes.
